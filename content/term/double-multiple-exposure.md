Double exposure is the superimposition of two images, one over the
other, which results from exposing the same film twice. <!--more-->This
technique, which is not used as much today as in the past, is employed
to create a ghost or a dissolve, or to make one character appear to be
two. In the case of Buster Keaton's <i>The Playhouse</i> (1921), multiple
exposure is used to create the illusion of a series of Keatons playing
in an orchestra.
