Derived from the French word <i>cinématographe</i> coined by the Lumière
brothers, cinematography literally means "writing in movement" and is
generally understood as the art and process of capturing visual images
with a camera for cinema. <!--more-->Closely related to photography,
cinematography has as much to do with lighting as it does with
film. Cinematography includes technical elements, such as camera,
lens, film stock, and [lighting](../lighting/), and more aesthetic
concerns, such as [camera angle](../camera-angle/), framing, duration
of shot, distance, and [movement](../camera-movement/).  The member of a film
crew who is responsible for cinematography is known as the
cinematographer, or director of photography.
