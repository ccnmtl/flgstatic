Also referred to as free cinema or direct cinema, cinema verité is a
French term that means "true cinema" or "cinema truth." It is a style
of filmmaking in documentaries which consists of [long
takes](../long-take/) and minimal directing or [editing](../editing/),
and is often made with no actors and a spare film crew, with a small
amount of equipment. Other elements typically identified with cinema
verité are portable sound equipment, the [handheld](../handheld-shot/)
camera, and impromptu interview techniques.

Albert Maysles and D. A. Pennebaker are two directors often associated
with cinema verité. Pennebaker made <i>Don't Look Back</i> (1965),
which covered Bob Dylan on a tour of England in 1965, and other
concert films, such as <i>Monterey Pop</i> (1968) and <i>Ziggy
Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i> (1973). Maysles, with his
brother, David, made such films as <i>Salesman</i> (1968), <i>Gimme
Shelter</i> (1969), and <i>Grey Gardens</i> (1976).
