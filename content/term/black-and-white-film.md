Black-and-white film contains an emulsion that, when processed,
changes colors into various shades of gray.<!--more-->

The earliest film stock was othochromatic--sensitive to blue and green
light waves--and then panchromatic, which is sensitive to all light
waves. By the end of the 1920s, panchromatic film stock, which creates
an image and emphasizes contrasts and shadows, became the norm. The
strong contrasts found in black-and-white film are apparent in this
scene from Charles Laughton's 1955 film, <i>The Night of the Hunter</i>.

By the late 1950s in Hollywood, with the development of Eastman Color,
making films in color soon became the rule. However, there were still
many films shot in black-and-white, ranging from international art
films to independent U.S. productions. Today, to shoot in
black-and-white is often an artistic or financial decision.
