Rear projection involves the projection of either a still or a moving
picture onto the back of a translucent screen. <!--more-->The screen appears
behind the live action being photographed, creating an effect whereby
both the background on the screen and the foreground action are
combined into a single image.

Rear projection had been used in still photography, and first appeared
in motion pictures as early as 1913. However, it wasn't until the
advent of sound, when studio shooting became necessary, that rear
projection became a common cinematic technique. One typical use of
rear projection involves filmed, moving scenery projected on a screen
while a character sits in a car, so that the car appears to be in
motion.
