With competition from television and other leisure activities
following the Second World War, Hollywood introduced a number of
technical innovations in an attempt to maintain audience numbers. One
such innovation was 3-D film. 3-D film has a three-dimensional,
stereoscopic form, creating the illusion of depth. <!--more-->This illusion is
typically achieved by the wearing of special red-and-blue (or
red-and-green) or polarized glasses. Among the major 3-D releases
during the postwar period were <i>House of Wax</i> (1953), <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>
(1953), and Alfred Hitchcock's <i>Dial M for Murder</i> (1954). Today, 3-D is
employed only rarely in Hollywood films, and is more often seen in
IMAX films or in specialized theaters at amusement parks or museums.
