Although contemporary filmgoers are familiar with
[dissolves](../dissolve/) and quick cuts as the standard for moving
from one scene to another, Golden Age editors and directors frequently
used "wipes" as a transitional effect. Wipes allow one scene to
effectively erase the previous scene and replace it. The wipe was
frequently used in the silent era, but it is probably associated more
accurately with the Art Deco look of the 1930s.

Hoping to recall that era, the director George Roy Hill revived the
wipe/split-screen effect in his nostalgic 1973 film, The Sting.
