Literally translated as "staging in action," mise-en-scène originated
in the theater and is used in film to refer to everything that goes
into the composition of a shot--framing, [movement of the
camera](../camera-movement/) and characters, [lighting](../lighting/),
set design and the visual environment, and [sound](../sound/).

### Early Cinema

Early cinema's finished products were often closer to stage dramas,
with a static camera stringing together a series of narrative
sections. Georges Méliès' <i>A Trip to the Moon</i> (1902) is an example of
this tendency toward the theatrical as opposed to the cinematic. The
beginnings of cinematic mise-en-scène are still apparent.

The term "mise-en-scène" is often used in film criticism to refer to
the director's control over what appears in the film frame--ranging
from real locations to the studio soundstage. In Robert Weine's 1919
film, <i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>, we see a dramatic example of a
world that is completely artificial. Furthermore, Conrad Veidt's
portrayal of the character Cesare shows the importance that acting
plays in mise-en-scène.

### Hollywood Styles

In Hollywood during the 1930s and '40s, the style and look of a film
could easily be associated with a particular studio. Vincente
Minnelli's film <i>Meet Me in St. Louis</i> (1944) is an excellent example of
the MGM style: elaborate sets, lit using full, high-key lighting,
taking advantage of the biggest costume, property, and art departments
in Hollywood.

Similarly, film noir in the postwar period developed its own
mise-en-scène. In this sequence from <i>Mildred Pierce</i> (1945), the
mise-en-scène emphasizes familiar themes in noir, like the idea of no
escape and the state of being on the run.

### International Styles

There are numerous interesting examples of mise-en-scène throughout
world cinema. Here, in a scene from Youssef Chahine's 1958 film <i>Cairo
Station</i>, we see a sophisticated mise-en-scène that used onscreen
space, camera movement, sound, and symbolism.

Similarly, in Zhang Yimou's <i>Raise the Red Lantern</i> (1991), we see an
intricate use of mise-en-scène that brings together an elaborate
(almost theater-like) set design, music, sound, and costume.

### Mise-en-scène and Realism

Because mise-en-scène is often focused on the composition of the
individual frame, scenes that rely less on [editing](../editing/) are
often cited as the best examples to study. The film critic and
theoretician André Bazin has written about cinema's unique ability to
capture "reality," through emphasizing what was in the frame,
invisible cutting, and the use of the [long take](../long-take/) and
[deep focus](../deep-focus/). Some have countered Bazin's argument,
saying that the effort necessary to compose an individual frame can in
fact create an image that is just as artificial as one that has
extensive cutting. At the very least, good mise-en-scène depends on
cinematic craftsmanship and can produce complicated and powerful
scenes, as we see here in an example from <i>Do the Right Thing</i> (1986).
