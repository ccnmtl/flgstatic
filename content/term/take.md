A take is one run of the camera, recording a single
shot. <!--more-->During the production of a film, it is not unusual
for there to be several takes of one shot, with the preferred or best
take being decided upon during the editing process. Before each take,
a [clapboard](../clapboard-slateboard/) appears in front of the camera, with the
number of the take written on it. In addition, the number of the take
is spoken aloud and recorded onto the soundtrack. Both the
photographing and the recording of the take number are done in
anticipation of the editing of the film.
