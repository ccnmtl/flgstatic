The long take, a shot of some duration, was not an aesthetic choice
when it was first used. Filmmakers in the early days of cinema had no
choice but to shoot their works in one continuous take, until the film
ran out. Even as it became technically possible to have cuts in films,
the finished product would often still look more like a stage drama,
with a static camera stringing together a series of narrative
sections. Georges Méliès's *A Trip to the Moon* (1902) demonstrates an
early use of long takes, albeit ones that tended more toward the
theatrical than the cinematic.

In the early 1940s, the long take began to assume a more important
role in the discussion of film aesthetics. The film critic and
theoretician André Bazin has written about cinema's unique ability to
capture "reality," through invisible cutting, the use of the long
take, and [deep focus](../deep-focus/). Bazin's theories offered an alternative to the
[montage theory](../montage/) proposed by the Soviet filmmakers of the 1920s, who
favored extensive [editing](../editing/) of their films. Two directors whom Bazin
cites often in his writings on the long take and deep focus are Jean
Renoir and Orson Welles. Throughout Welles's *Citizen Kane* (1941), for
instance, there are a number of examples of deep focus combined with
the long take.

A number of films today make use of the long take. Others through the
years include Alfred Hitchcock's *Rope* (1948), which, through editing,
creates the impression of an entire film taking placing during one
take, and Mike Figgis's *Timecode* (2000), which shot digitally four
ninety-minute takes concurrently.
