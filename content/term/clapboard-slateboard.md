<b>Clapboard</b>

Before each take, a clapboard appears in front of the camera, with the
number of the [take](../take/) written on it. In addition, the number
of the take is spoken aloud and recorded onto the soundtrack. Both the
photographing and the recording of the take number are done for the
synchronization of [sound](../sound/) and picture, in anticipation of
the [editing](../editing/) of the film. In addition to the take
number, other information on the slate could include the date, the
scene number, the name of the film, and the cameraman.
