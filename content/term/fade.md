The fade is a means of gradually beginning or ending a scene, and is
achieved in the camera by opening or closing the aperture; in an
optical printer, this is achieved when the exposure light is increased
or decreased.<!--more--> The fade is used in a number of different ways--when one
scene closes with the image disappearing (fade-out), then
transitioning into the next scene, which slowly comes into view
(fade-in); or, in a fade to black, when a scene or film ends with an
image gradually becoming darker (or lighter, in the case of fade to
white).
