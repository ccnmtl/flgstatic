title: 180-Degree Rule
---

The 180-degree rule of shooting and [editing](../editing/) keeps the
camera on one side of the action. <!--more-->As a matter of convention, the
camera stays on one side of the axis of action throughout a scene;
this keeps characters grounded compositionally on a particular side of
the screen or frame, and keeps them looking at one another when only
one character is seen onscreen at a time. The technique allows for an
expansion of the frame into the unseen space offscreen. It is referred
to as a rule because the camera, when shooting two actors, must not
cross over the axis of action; if it does, it risks giving the
impression that the actors' positions in the scene have been reversed.

There are instances when the 180-degree rule is violated. For
instance, the director Yasujro Ozu often tampers with sight lines and
crosses the axis with ease. Ozu reverses camera angles, breaking with
convention, and creates an almost purely cinematic tension within
scenes. We are forced to see characters with reversed screen
placement, sight lines, and even movement. While the continuity of the
scene holds, this change of placement serves to make the audience both
uneasy and attentive.
