Dialogue is speech delivered by or between characters. <!--more-->With the advent
of [sound](../sound/), in the late 1920s, Hollywood films became
increasingly dialogue-heavy. At first, the increased dialogue was
merely compensating for the lack of camera movement, which was a
limitation of the new sound cameras. Eventually, it became clear that
dialogue could enhance the narrative of films in ways that were
previously unavailable with silent film. Sharp, quick, dialogue-rich
films distinguished some of Hollywood's best work from the 1920s
through the 1950s.
