Superimposition is when two or more image are placed over each other
in the frame.<!--more--> This effect can be accomplished by exposing
the same piece of film more than once as we see with double exposure.
In narrative film, superimposition is often used for dissolve shots.
In Kenneth Anger's experimental film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome
(1954), Anger superimposed up to four images on top of each other.
