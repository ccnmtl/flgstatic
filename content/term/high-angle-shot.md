A high-angle shot is one in which the camera is placed above eye level, creating a frame that looks down at the subject.  Early examples of high-angle shots represent the point of view of a distant onlooker, as in James Williamson’s *Attack on a Chinese Mission Station* (1901) and Frank Mottershaw’s influential early crime film, *Daring Daylight Burglary* (1903).  

The consistent use of high angle objective, expressive shots taken from close to the subject emerges in France in the 1920s with films such as Jean Epstein’s *l’Auberge* (1923) and Maurice *L’Herbier’s L’inhumaine* (1924).  
 
Depending on the stylistic language established by the filmmaker, a high-angle shot may suggest that a character has lower status or is needier than another character.

It is tempting but inaccurate to read high angle shots consistently through an easy literal metaphor:  in “looking down” on a subject, a high angle confers vulnerability and low status.  If this were true, Hitchcock’s use of high angles would be illegible when, for example, in *North by Northwest* (1959), Van Damm decides to murder his mistress by pushing her out of an airplane.  

Extreme high-angles can suggest surveillance, such as in the following shot from *The Conversation* (1974):

High-angle shots can imbue a sub-human character to a subject, as in this shot from *Taxi Driver* (1976):

CLIP:  (Shot of Travis walking into diner) 

A high angle shot may reframe authority, as in this shot from Ousmane Sembene’s *Moolaadé*, where Collé defies village traditionalists who seek to circumcise girls in her protection:  

CLIP:  (Shot of Village in stand-off.)
