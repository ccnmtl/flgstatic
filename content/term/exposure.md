Exposure is the act of making film available to light so that an image
is formed in the emulsion.<!--more--> The scene's lighting--natural or set
up--and the length of time exposed to light determines the exposure in
a shot. Film that is overexposed, which occurs when the film has been
exposed to light for an extended period of time, tends to have a
bleached-out look; conversely, underexposed film looks dark. The
effect of the dream sequence at the start of Ingmar Bergman's <i>Wild
Strawberries</i> (1957) is achieved through overexposure, the nature of
the film stock, and laboratory processing.

Unless a particular aesthetic affect is intended, film is exposed to a
level at which there will be a clear image that is consistent
throughout the film. A light meter is frequently used to calculate the
f-stop number. Specifically, the meter measures either incident light
or the light reflecting off a subject and calculates the number. In
addition to the f-stop, the t-top calculates the transmission of
light. An exposure calculator can be used to determine the exposure
setting as well. Finally, camera speed and film emulsion can also
determine exposure.
