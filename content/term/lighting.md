Lighting is responsible for the quality of a film's images and often a
film's dramatic effect. <!--more-->Early photoplays were usually filmed outside,
with natural light, or in studios with glass roofs. Eventually, better
lighting techniques made it possible for studio productions to have a
more natural look.

German Expressionist filmmakers of the silent era started to
experiment with light to create [chiaroscuro](../chiaroscuro/)
lighting--the presence of extremely dark and light areas in an image.

Hollywood developed a distinct style in the first three decades of the
sound era, marked by carefully balanced studio lights in a style known
as three-point lighting (consisting of key light, fill light, and
backlight). While this lighting style often seems artificial and
unreal, it is very much like classical [editing](../editing/)--that
is, a pleasing composition that is meant to be unobtrusive. At the
same time, the 1940s and '50s in Hollywood saw the rise of film
noir. Taking many stylistic cues from German Expressionist filmmaking,
the lighting in film noir often makes use of low-key lighting,
bringing about a dramatic interplay of light and shadow.

Many of the first innovations with lighting occurred in
black-and-white films. But there are notable examples of color films
that made excellent use of lighting. This clip from Alfred Hitchcock's
Vertigo (1957) demonstrates how compositional effects can be created
using different colors.

During the 1950s, more sensitive color film stocks came into use,
allowing filmmakers to integrate lighting into the
[mise-en-sc√®ne](../misenscene/) and achieve a more natural
image. Stanley Kubrick's <i>Barry Lyndon</i> (1975) employs lighting in a far
more naturalistic way than early color films did. This scene from the
film is lit entirely by candlelight.
