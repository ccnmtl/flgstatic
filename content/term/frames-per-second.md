Frames-per-second is the rate at which film is exposed in a
camera. <!--more-->Silent films were shot and projected in a range from 16 to 18
frames-per-second. With the birth of the sound era, it became
necessary to shoot and project at 24 frames-per-second, in order to
produce clear sound on the optical soundtrack.

Changing the number of frames-per-second can result in a variety of
effects. For instance, shooting a scene at 48 frames-per-second and
then projecting it at 24 frames-per-second creates [slow
motion](../slow-motion/), since each frame is shown at twice the
length of the original.
