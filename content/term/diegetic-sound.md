Diegetic sound is any sound that emanates from the story (or
narrative) world of a film, which is referred to in film studies as
diegesis.<!--more--> Diegetic sound can include everything from the voices of
characters to the sounds of objects or music coming from a radio or an
instrument--anything that exists in the story world. In this clip from
