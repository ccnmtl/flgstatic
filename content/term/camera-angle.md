Camera angle refers to where the camera is placed in relation to the
subject of the image.<!--more--> In general, the camera is placed approximately
at eye level, or up to six feet off the ground.



[Low angle](../lowangle-shot/) refers to when the camera is placed
below eye level. The viewer is therefore looking up at the subject.
