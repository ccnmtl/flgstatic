Taken with a lens that has a variable focal length, a zoom shot is one
that permits the cinematographer to change the distance between the
camera and the object being filmed without actually moving the
camera. <!--more-->In one continuous movement, this camera technique makes an
object or subject in the frame appear larger or smaller. In Alfred
Hitchcock's <i>Vertigo</i> (1958), the length of the stairway is made to seem
longer with a combination of zoom and [dolly](../dolly/) back.
