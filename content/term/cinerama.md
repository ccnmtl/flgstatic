Facing an economic challenge from television in the 1950s, Hollywood
studios relied on spectacle to draw audiences back to movie
theaters. This accounts for the frenzy of wide-screen epics (such as
<i>Quo Vadis</i> and <i>Ben-Hur</i>) during that era. There were many
systems in use, but the most highly touted was Cinerama, which was
first presented at the 1939 New York World's Fair as Vitarama.

Cinerama is a process of simultaneous filming by three cameras. The
cameras are pointed at different angles and are then projected by
three synchronized projectors and shown on a curved screen.

Cinerama made its commercial debut in 1952, with the film <i>This Is
Cinerama</i> (Merian C. Cooper).  A thrill-packed travelogue that features
a roller-coaster ride and an air trip through the Grand Canyon, the
film exploited three (slightly angled) images, three projectors, and
three screens to provide a sensation of "being there" vastness and
breadth. The premiere and subsequent Cinerama projects were
commercially successful, but the system was ungainly (for example, the
supposedly coordinated images could fall out of synch in a jarring
manner). When the 70-mm. process was perfected, it essentially
replaced Cinerama.
