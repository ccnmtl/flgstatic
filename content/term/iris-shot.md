Particularly popular during the silent film era, the iris shot is a shot masked in a circular form. (Other shapes, such as a rectangle, a triangle, or a diamond, can also be used.) The iris shot typically has been employed to gradually begin or end a scene. Other uses include calling attention to an object or character, or creating the impression of looking through a small area like a keyhole.
