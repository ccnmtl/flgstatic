title: "About the Columbia Film Language Glossary"
---

The Columbia Film Language Glossary (FLG) is designed to enhance screenings, readings, lectures, and discussions for any course that involves the study of film. It provides definitions of essential terms used in basic and advanced film courses that are representative of all the major categories of film studies: practical terminology, technical terminology, the language of business, and historical terms, as well as the language of criticism and theory. Through the use of multimedia within the definitions, users will have a more complete understanding of the terms being definedâ€”an explanation of the theory and a demonstration of the practice. Specifically, terms combine visual text, film clips, and audio commentary in creative ways, delivering them in high-quality media for classroom use and private study.

The Film Language Glossary is available to any student of film. Definitions and audio commentary are written and narrated by faculty at Columbia University.
